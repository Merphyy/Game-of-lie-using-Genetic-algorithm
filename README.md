# Game-of-lie-using-Genetic-algorithm
This is the final project of the course Info 6205 which implemented the Conway Game Of Life using genetic algorithm.
In the project, our team also implemented the UI which you can see the progress vividly by running the code in the src/main/java/edu/neu/coe/info6205/ui/UIStart.java.
And there is also console display without using the UI by running the code in the src/main/java/edu/neu/coe/info6205/geneticAlgorithm/AllOnesGA.java.
In this program, our team also implemented the multithread to accelerate the progress of the outcome.
